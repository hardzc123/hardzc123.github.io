                    My journey with robotics began in 2009 during the China Youth Robotics Competition. At the time, we were tasked with building various small vehicles and movable tools using LEGO components. These robots had to complete a series of actions within a designated map, such as navigating using ground markings, picking up objects, transporting them, and stopping at specified locations. The performance was scored based on the number and quality of tasks completed. Ultimately, my team and I proudly earned third place in the competition.

                <p style="text-align: left;">
                    Through this project, I became fascinated with robotics. I learned how to design efficient mechanical structures using LEGO, how to use ultrasonic sensors for distance measurement, and how to employ vision modules for line tracking. I also discovered how to harness motors to enable movement, turning, and, through intricate linkage mechanisms, execute complex tool-based actions.

                <p style="text-align: left;">
                    This experience ignited my lifelong passion for robotics and autonomous systems, setting me on the path I continue to follow today.
