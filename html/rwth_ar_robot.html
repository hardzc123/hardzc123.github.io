                <p style="text-align: left;">
                    This project focused on leveraging Microsoft Hololens and AR technology to intuitively control a robotic arm. The goal was to create an immersive interface where operators could manipulate the robotic arm in real time through natural hand movements, while receiving immediate visual feedback on the robot’s status within the AR environment. The key technical areas involved were ROS (Robot Operating System) communication, Unity 3D environment development, and human-machine interaction design.

                <p style="text-align: left;">
                    My primary responsibility in the project was establishing and maintaining reliable ROS communication. I developed the system to ensure that the operator's hand motion commands, captured by the Hololens, were accurately transmitted to the robotic arm. This required efficient and real-time processing to minimize latency and ensure precise control. Additionally, I implemented the functionality to stream the robot’s state data back to the Hololens, enabling dynamic updates of the AR model’s posture and ensuring that the 3D visualization accurately reflected the robot’s real-time movements and status.
                </p>

                <p style="text-align: left;">
                    By integrating these components, the project achieved seamless two-way communication between the operator and the robot, creating an intuitive and responsive control system. This work not only showcased the potential of AR in robotics but also provided valuable insights into human-machine interaction design for advanced robotic systems.
