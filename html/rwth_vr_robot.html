                    My masterâ€™s thesis explores the integration of virtual reality (VR) gamification with robotic systems to enhance the rehabilitation of stroke patients suffering from upper limb motor impairments. Traditional rehabilitation methods, while effective, often suffer from low patient motivation due to their repetitive and monotonous nature. To address this challenge, my research aimed to design a patient-centered VR game tailored for upper limb rehabilitation, which integrates seamlessly with a robotic manipulator.

                <p style="text-align: left;">
                    The project involved developing a VR game environment, where task-oriented and repetitive movements guided by gamified feedback were employed to encourage patient participation. I implemented advanced control strategies using the Robot Operating System (ROS) to enable precise two-way communication between the VR system and the robot. This ensured that the patient's real-time movements influenced the VR environment while the robotic arm provided adaptive support as needed. The VR game incorporated design principles such as goal-setting, feedback mechanisms, and individualized difficulty adjustment to optimize therapy outcomes.

                <p style="text-align: left;">
                    The system was tested through integration and usability experiments, where participants demonstrated improved motivation and engagement. The results suggested that the combination of VR gamification and robotics not only enhances patient adherence but also facilitates functional improvements in upper limb recovery.

                <p style="text-align: left;">
                    This thesis contributes to the growing field of technology-assisted rehabilitation by providing a novel approach to bridging robotics, VR, and gamification to create an engaging and effective therapeutic experience for stroke survivors.
