                    <p>
                        This course focused on key areas of vehicle automation, covering localization, control systems, testing, and real-time software architecture. The main topics are organized as follows:
                    </p>
                    <h3>1. Localization and Mapping</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Satellite Navigation:</strong> Addressed challenges in satellite navigation and improved accuracy using correction services and inertial sensor integration.</li>
                        <li><strong>Sensor Fusion with Kalman Filter:</strong> Integrated GNSS and inertial measurements (acceleration and rotation rates) to estimate vehicle position, orientation, and velocity with high accuracy. Used Kalman Filters to fuse sensor data and reduce noise, enabling smooth and precise localization in real-time.</li>
                        <li><strong>Map Integration:</strong> Incorporated map data for nearby waypoint navigation. Designed systems to guide vehicles along predefined paths, reducing degrees of freedom for simplified control and experimentation.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>2. Control Systems and Testing</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Platooning:</strong> Developed systems to maintain constant distances between vehicles using communication-based longitudinal control. Designed individual lateral controllers for lane-following, ensuring accurate trajectory tracking.</li>
                        <li><strong>Predictive Control:</strong> Applied motion models to predict steering behavior and vehicle dynamics. Utilized model-based predictive control to calculate optimal steering angles for accurate lane-following.</li>
                        <li><strong>PID Controller Design:</strong> Designed and tuned PID controllers using Ziegler-Nichols methods. Addressed issues like integrator windup to enhance control system performance.</li>
                        <li><strong>Testing and Validation:</strong> Used the Test Vehicle with built-in Hardware-in-the-Loop (HiL) simulation for efficient and realistic testing of control strategies. Applied Model-in-the-Loop (MIL) and Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) approaches to validate and refine control systems. Simulated control flow and system behavior in Simulink to ensure robustness and reliability.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>3. Real-Time Systems and Software Architecture</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Real-Time System Design:</strong> Developed hard real-time systems for safety-critical applications, such as traffic control systems. Optimized system architecture to minimize jitter and ensure fast responses to asynchronous events.</li>
                        <li><strong>Software Architecture Principles:</strong> Designed systems that separate real-time and non-real-time components. Enabled independent computations across multiple time loops and effective scheduling of periodic and non-periodic tasks. Used operating systems for efficient task planning and execution.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>
                        This course provided an in-depth understanding of vehicle automation, integrating theoretical concepts with practical applications. By employing Kalman Filters for sensor fusion, predictive control models, and rigorous testing with the Test Vehicle, participants gained hands-on experience in developing reliable and efficient autonomous driving systems.
